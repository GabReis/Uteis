Info:
Super Penguin Bros. is an open source game based on the original Super Mario Bros.
game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It is programmed in c++ with OpenGL
and glut.  All of the images were drawn by me (Kyle Gancarz) in MS Paint.If you 
are interested in contributing to this project, contact me via email
(tommacco@swirve.com), AOL Instant Messenger (tommacco64), or irc.openprojects.net
(tommacco, I'll make an effort to start #SuperPenguinBros).  I have need for
artists, sound people, programmers, a web site, promotion, anything you're willing
to do for free (this is free software after all).

Compiling:

All: You need OpenGL for your operating system (shipped with most compilers or 
 systems), a glut distribution (available for download for unix and windows on the
 net somewhere, contact me if you can't find it any other way, and a c++ compiler.
 

MS Windows: (I've included a binary distribution for Windows)
 Visual C++:
    The project file should be included with the Windows source distribution, just
    load it up and build.
 Borland/Others:
    Compile main.cpp and link the OpenGL libraries required

Linux/UNIX:
    I've included a file "compile" in the distribution, just run ./compile and it
    should compile correctly.  If it doesn't, compile main.cpp and link in what
    libraries required.
